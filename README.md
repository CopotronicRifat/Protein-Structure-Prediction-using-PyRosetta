# Protein Structure Prediction using PyRosetta

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources developed during my graduate thesis on protein structure prediction. The project leverages [PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org), a Python-based interface to the Rosetta molecular modeling suite, to predict and analyze protein structures.

## Repository Structure

- **CODES/**: Directory containing Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for various stages of protein structure prediction and analysis.
- **DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS/**: Collection of relevant research papers and documentation that provide background and context for the methodologies employed.
- **PROJECT REPORT WITH LATEX CODE.zip**: Compressed archive containing the LaTeX source files and compiled report detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, results, and conclusions.

## Getting Started

To replicate or build upon this work, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CopotronicRifat/Protein-Structure-Prediction-using-PyRosetta.git
   ```

2. **Set Up PyRosetta**:
   - Obtain PyRosetta by following the instructions on the [official website](http://www.pyrosetta.org).
   - Install the necessary dependencies, including Python and Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Explore the Code**:
   - Navigate to the `CODES/` directory to access the scripts and notebooks.
   - Review the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step guidance on protein structure prediction tasks.

4. **Consult Documentation**:
   - Refer to the materials in the `DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS/` directory for theoretical background and detailed explanations of the methodologies used.

## Resources

For additional learning and support:

- **PyRosetta Manual**: Comprehensive guide on using PyRosetta for protein modeling.
- **PyRosetta Tutorials**: A series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to teach the fundamentals of PyRosetta.
- **PyRosetta YouTube Tutorial**: An introductory video on utilizing PyRosetta for protein structure prediction.
